# Abq Parks
Abq Parks is an application created to facilitate the location of parks with specific amenities in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The aim is to reduce the amount of time needed for users to find amenities (basketball courts, jogging areas, pools, etc.), so that they may
enjoy more of their favorite activity. 

## Current State
All the basic functions of Abq Parks are operational with the opportunity to improve in some areas. Users are able to see parks in local 
area and obtain directions with the implementation of Google Maps.The amenity search option returns parks that contain one or more of
the amenities the user is searching for. Reviews can be posted and read.

Items that can be improved are primarily centered around UI/UX. Also, the app would benefit from the creation of local persistent
storage to improve performance.
